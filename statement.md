# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
Many colleges have difficulty keeping track of campus-related information to manage students, courses, and enrollments. There is currently no single place that organizes this information in a simple and accessible and easy-to-navigate manner. 
This project aims to solve this by having a beneficial application based on Java framework, users can add and list students or courses, enroll students in courses, view enrollments, and perform file backup operations.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The project scope includes:
- The development of a Java-based application that has an intuitive and clean user accessing the application interface.
- Access to viewing academic notices, department links, or important college resources for students.
- Easy access to navigating to common services such as portals, contact information, or updates to the standard services.
- A framework that is developed in a system architecture with a structure that could be extended with more modules in future versions.
- Lightweight, responsive application to be usable by students on normal campus hardware.

## 3. Target Users
The intended users for this project are:
**College Students** - as they often have a need for access to academic, and campus information.
**New Students** - students who often have the larger role of finding official links, or checking on updates.
**Faculty Members (optional)** - Faculty who might be looking to share any of the resources or verify anything listed.
**Campus Administrators (optional future scope)** - who may update or manage content in later versions.

## 4. High-Level Features
**Centralized Dashboard:** A clean homepage displaying all major categories clearly.
**Access to Important Links:** Department pages, academic portals, notice boards, and other official resources.
**Simple UI Navigation:** Organized options and intuitive flow between the modules.
**Static Data Integration:** Pre-defined links and sections loaded directly in the application for fast access.
**Scalability:** Ability to add advanced modules such as authentication, notifications, real-time updates, and database storage in future versions.
